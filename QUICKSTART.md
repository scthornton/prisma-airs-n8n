## 💬 How to Use the Chat

### Type a Message
```
Hello! Can you explain how Prisma AIRS works?
```

### Watch It Work
1. Your message goes through Prisma AIRS security scan (purple node)
2. If safe, it's sent to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (green nodes)
3. If unsafe, you get a security alert (red path)

### View Execution Details
- Click on any node in the workflow to see what happened
- Check the **Executions** panel on the left to see history
- Each chat shows the full security analysis

## 🛡️ Security Features

Your chat is protected by Prisma AIRS which checks for:
- ✅ Prompt injection attempts
- ✅ Malicious content
- ✅ PII/sensitive data leaks
- ✅ Policy violations
- ✅ Jailbreak attempts
